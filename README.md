You want to learn what happens behind the scenes of any Transformers Model? This is your go-to notebook on Transformers Implementation, one step at a time.

We built everything from scratch using Pytorch. Files Tran.py are used to train this model for a simple translation project.

Have some coffee! Give it a read and share your experiences. Couldn't upload it on kaggle with these many images so sharing my best version here. Rest you can find the same code on my kaggle without Paper References and memes xd.

Learning is Fun! Even more when you know what's happening behind the scenes :)
